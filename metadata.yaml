description: A wealthy and unattached young idler, Richard Kendrick, runs an errand
  for his even wealthier uncle whose heir he is--and finds himself in the warm, lively,
  and industrious Gray home. Seeing such family life for the very first time, he is
  equally fascinated by the experience as by the charming Roberta Gray. Before long,
  Richard finds a way to install himself in the Gray home as a secretary to Miss Gray's
  uncle. But although the family at large takes Richard to their heart, he finds Roberta
  prickly and often even forbidding. Soon, it becomes clear that she looks down on
  him as a good-for-nothing socialite. Will Richard rise to the challenge and find
  a useful occupation? Can he really be as useless as Roberta thinks? Will Richard
  finally be able to set up the home he's come to dream of?
